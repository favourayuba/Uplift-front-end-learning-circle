# Uplift-front-end-learning-circle
heyy, this is favour ayuba,
I am an aspiring front-end developer passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences. Currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aim to build responsive websites that look great on any device. With a keen eye for design and a commitment to continuous learning, I’m eager to explore modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. Outside of coding, I enjoy following the latest design trends and contributing to open-source projects. I’m excited about my journey in the tech world!
criticisms are welcome as i am open to learning 
thanks for reading through.
